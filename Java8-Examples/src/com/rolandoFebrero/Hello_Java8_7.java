		Filtering is one of the common operation Java developers 
		perform with large collections, and you will be surprise how much 
		easy it is now to filter bulk data/large collection using lambda 
		expression and stream API.  Stream provides a filter() method, 
		which accepts a Predicate object, means you can pass lambda 
		expression to this method as filtering logic. Following examples of 
		filtering collection in Java with lambda expression will make it 
		easy to understand.
