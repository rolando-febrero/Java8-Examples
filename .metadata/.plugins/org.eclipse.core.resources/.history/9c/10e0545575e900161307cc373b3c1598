	 * 	Applying function on Each element of List

		List e.g. multiplying each element by certain number or dividing it, 
		or doing anything with that. Those operations are perfectly suited 
		for map() method, you can supply your transformation logic to map() method 
		as lambda expression and it will transform each element of that 
		collection, as shown in below example.
